** Dataset information**:
- file size: 1.32 GB
- number of unique email accounts: 259
- number of emails: 517,401

## Focus of Network Analysis
Due to the size of the dataset, preliminary analysis focused on three individuals playing notable roles at Enron at that time.
- **Kenneth (Ken) Lay**: founder, long-time CEO and Chairman of the Board
- **Jeffrey Skilling**: long-time COO and CEO for a brief period (02/2001 - 08/2001)
- ** Vincent J. Kaminski**: Managing Director for Research; responsible for quantitative modelling to assist Enron's energy trading and other parts of ther business; in the month's preceding Enron's bankruptcy and following a company-wide risk-assessment, Kaminski repeatedly raised strong objections to the financial practices of then CFO, Andrew Fastow, designed to conceal Enron's true debt.
